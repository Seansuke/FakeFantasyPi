/*
To receive events like mouse and keyboard input, or GUI events like "the OK
button has been clicked", we need an object which is derived from the
irr::IEventReceiver object. There is only one method to override:
irr::IEventReceiver::OnEvent(). This method will be called by the engine once
when an event happens. What we really want to know is whether a key is being
held down, and so we will remember the current state of each key.
